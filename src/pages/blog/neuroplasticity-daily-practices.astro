                <p class="text-neutral-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    A groundbreaking 2023 study published in the journal <em>Nature Neuroscience</em> examined
                    how the brain responds to micro-practices—brief, focused activities lasting just 5-10 minutes.
                    Researchers tracked 200 participants over six months, measuring changes in brain structure
                    through fMRI imaging.

                <p class="text-neutral-700 leading-relaxed">
                    The findings were remarkable: participants who engaged in daily micro-practices showed
                    significant increases in grey matter density in regions associated with learning, memory,
                    and emotional regulation, comparable to those who engaged in longer practice sessions.

                    <li>✓ 5-10 minute daily practices showed equal neuroplastic effects as 30-minute sessions</li>
                    <li>✓ Consistency mattered more than duration for structural brain changes</li>
                    <li>✓ Effects were visible within 4 weeks of daily practice</li>
                    <li>✓ Multiple brief sessions throughout the day enhanced results further</li>

                    This research supports homework assignments that emphasize brief, daily practices rather
                    than lengthy weekly exercises. Consider prescribing "micro-practices" that clients can
                    realistically maintain, tracking consistency over duration.
